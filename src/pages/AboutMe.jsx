        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>Born in Panevėžys, Lithuania, in 1993, I have always sought my place in the world. My life has taken various paths that have shaped my perspective and enriched my understanding of the world. Throughout my journey, I have accumulated valuable experiences and knowledge that I now put into practice. As a highly motivated, passionate, and dedicated graduate student with a diverse cultural and multidisciplinary background, I possess excellent communication and English language skills, as well as a strong ability to work in teams and solve problems. Living in both Italy, Denmark, and Portugal, for several months has exposed me to different cultures and broadened my horizons. My ultimate dream and ambition are to move to Canada and immerse myself in its stimulating and innovative environment.</p>
